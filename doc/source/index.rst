*Need to visualize a rather large (gigabytes) raster you have locally?* **This is for you.**

  Try it out below!

.. jupyter-execute::

  from localtileserver import get_leaflet_tile_layer, examples
  from ipyleaflet import Map

  # Create a TileClient from a raster file
  # client = TileClient('path/to/geo.tif')
  client = examples.get_san_francisco()  # use example data

  # Create ipyleaflet TileLayer from that server
  t = get_leaflet_tile_layer(client)
  # Create ipyleaflet map, add tile layer, and display
  m = Map(center=client.center(), zoom=client.default_zoom)
  m.add_layer(t)
  m

A Flask application for serving tiles from large raster files in
the `Slippy Maps standard <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames>`_
(i.e., ``/zoom/x/y.png``)

üåü Highlights
=============

- Launch a tile server for large geospatial images
- View local or remote* raster files with ``ipyleaflet`` or ``folium`` in Jupyter
- View rasters with CesiumJS with the built-in Flask web application
- Extract regions of interest (ROIs) interactively
- Use the example datasets to generate Digital Elevation Models

*remote raster files should be pre-tiled Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs*

‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
===========

This is a Flask application (blueprint) for serving tiles of large images.
The :class:`TileClient` class can be used to to launch a tile server in a background
thread which will serve raster imagery to a viewer (see ``ipyleaflet`` and
``folium`` examples in :ref:`user_guide`).

This tile server can efficiently deliver varying levels of detail of your
raster imagery to your viewer; it helps to have pre-tiled, Cloud Optimized
GeoTIFFs (COG), but no wories if not as the backing libraries,
`large_image <https://github.com/girder/large_image>`_,
will tile and cache for you when opening the raster.

There is an included, standalone web viewer leveraging
`CesiumJS <https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/>`_ and `GeoJS <https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/>`_.
You can use the web viewer to select and extract regions of interest from rasters.


.. note::

   This is a hobby project and I am doing my best to make it
   more stable/robust. Things might break between minor releases (I use the
   ``major.minor.patch`` versioning scheme).


ü™¢ Community Usage
==================

- `leafmap <https://github.com/giswqs/leafmap>`_ and `geemap <https://github.com/giswqs/geemap>`_: use localtileserver for visualizing large raster images in a Jupyter-based geospatial mapping application
- `streamlit-geospatial <https://github.com/giswqs/streamlit-geospatial>`_: uses localtileserver's flask-based remote tile server for viewing image tiles
- `remotetileserver <https://github.com/banesullivan/remotetileserver>`_: uses the core flask application to spin up a production ready tile server
- `Kaustav Mukherjee's blog post <https://kaustavmukherjee-66179.medium.com/visualize-raster-tiles-locally-using-localtileserver-0-4-1-and-jupyter-notebook-cccd59e6420a>`_: a user-created demonstration on how to get started with localtileserver
